Blair IV is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield from 1983 to 2007 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.\r\n- **Matt Bockmann.** Matt Bockmann is a recent BSEE from UMass. His free-time hacking is mostly focused on Python programming and learning to make make useful projects and libraries with Arduino and Zigbee wireless radios. He would be happy to help others design using ICs and discrete components.\r\n- **Jiansheng Feng.**  Jiansheng grew up in Foshan, Guangdong, China. He got his B.S. degree in Materials Science from Univ. Sci. & Tech. China in 2006. He is currently a sixth-year graduate student, Ph.D. candidate, in Physics at UMass Amherst. His research interest is fluid dynamics on micro-/nano-structured surfaces. His other passions include small electronics, automation, environmental sensing, computer simulation, and travelling.\r\n- **Chris Fastie.** Chris is a forest ecologist and Visiting Research Scholar in the Biology Department at Middlebury College in Vermont.  His research focuses on Alaskan forest response to fire, insect outbreak, glacier retreat, river dynamics, and climate change.  He is investigating ways to monitor permanent vegetation study plots using open source tools including the near-infrared camera developed by the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (e.g., http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots).\r\n- **Ben Gamari.**\r\n- **Craig Versek.** Craig Versek grew up outside Philadelphia in a humble middle class home.  He was a curious youth and wanted to figure out how things worked, attempting his own electronics and home-brew chemistry projects without any guidance.  After singeing the carpet a few times and often releasing that magic blue smoke (that which makes all electronics work), he eventually turned his attention primarily to the safer domain of computers and software (much to his parents' relief).  The low barrier-to-entry of current open source hardware prototyping kits has led him back to his childhood passions, but now with the zeal of a \"professional\" experimental physicist.  His heroes include Humphrey Davy, Ben Franklin, Charles S. Peirce, and.... MacGyver.\r\n\r\n###Questions/Contact###\r\nContact Don Blair at: donblair at gmail dot com\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out."}
