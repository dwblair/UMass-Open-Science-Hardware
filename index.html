<li>
<strong>Don Blair.</strong> Donald W. Blair IV is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield from 1983 to 2007 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.</li>
<li>
<strong>Matt Bockmann.</strong> Matt Bockmann is a recent BSEE from UMass. His free-time hacking is mostly focused on Python programming and learning to make make useful projects and libraries with Arduino and Zigbee wireless radios. He would be happy to help others design using ICs and discrete components.</li>
<li>
<strong>Jiansheng Feng.</strong>  Jiansheng grew up in Foshan, Guangdong, China. He got his B.S. degree in Materials Science from Univ. Sci. &amp; Tech. China in 2006. He is currently a sixth-year graduate student, Ph.D. candidate, in Physics at UMass Amherst. His research interest is fluid dynamics on micro-/nano-structured surfaces. His other passions include small electronics, automation, environmental sensing, computer simulation, and travelling.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chris Fastie.</strong> Chris is a forest ecologist and Visiting Research Scholar in the Biology Department at Middlebury College in Vermont.  His research focuses on Alaskan forest response to fire, insect outbreak, glacier retreat, river dynamics, and climate change.  He is investigating ways to monitor permanent vegetation study plots using open source tools including the near-infrared camera developed by the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (e.g., <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots">http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Ben Gamari.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Craig Versek.</strong> Craig Versek grew up outside Philadelphia in a humble middle class home.  He was a curious youth and wanted to figure out how things worked, attempting his own electronics and home-brew chemistry projects without any guidance.  After singeing the carpet a few times and often releasing that magic blue smoke (that which makes all electronics work), he eventually turned his attention primarily to the safer domain of computers and software (much to his parents' relief).  The low barrier-to-entry of current open source hardware prototyping kits has led him back to his childhood passions, but now with the zeal of a "professional" experimental physicist.  His heroes include Humphrey Davy, Ben Franklin, Charles S. Peirce, and.... MacGyver.</li>
