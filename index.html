      <h3>Description:</h3>
      The open hardware community has been evolving rapidly in recent years, and there now exists a vast array of easy-to-use, inexpensive, modular and highly flexible hardware designs that are becoming increasingly useful for the rapid prototyping and implementation of cutting edge, accessible scientific instrumentation.  We hope this workshop will serve as an introduction to this ecosystem through several demos, and will generate discussion around how to accelerate its adoption in research.

<h3>Presenters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Don Blair.</strong> Don is a graduate student in Physics at UMass Amherst. He has been studying problems in Soft Matter, Condensed Matter, and Biophysics, as well as bits of Computational Complexity Theory and Information Theory.</li>
<li><strong>Matt Bockmann.</strong> Matt is a recent BSEE from UMass. His free-time hacking is mostly focused on Python programming and learning to make make useful projects and libraries with Arduino and Zigbee wireless radios. He would be happy to help others design using ICs and discrete components.</li>
<li>
<strong>Jiansheng Feng.</strong>  Jiansheng grew up in Foshan, Guangdong, China. He got his B.S. degree in Materials Science from Univ. Sci. &amp; Tech. China in 2006. He is currently a sixth-year graduate student, Ph.D. candidate, in Physics at UMass Amherst. His research interest is fluid dynamics on micro-/nano-structured surfaces. His other passions include small electronics, automation, environmental sensing, computer simulation, and travelling.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chris Fastie.</strong> Chris is a forest ecologist and Visiting Research Scholar in the Biology Department at Middlebury College in Vermont.  His research focuses on Alaskan forest response to fire, insect outbreak, glacier retreat, river dynamics, and climate change.  He is investigating ways to monitor permanent vegetation study plots using open source tools including the near-infrared camera developed by the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (e.g., <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots">http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Ben Gamari.</strong> Ben is a graduate student in the Physics Department at the University of Massachussetts Amherst where he is studying the properties of biopolymers through single-molecule spectroscopy in the group of Professor Lori Goldner. In his research, Ben seeks to further understanding of the conformational properties of biopolymers through fluorescence techniques along with advanced statistical analysis. He is also an open-source advocate, programmer, and turtle owner. In his spare time he enjoys building things, learning programming languages, listening to music, and being outdoors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Craig Versek.</strong> Craig Versek grew up outside Philadelphia in a humble middle class home.  He was a curious youth and wanted to figure out how things worked, attempting his own electronics and home-brew chemistry projects without any guidance.  After singeing the carpet a few times and often releasing that magic blue smoke (that which makes all electronics work), he eventually turned his attention primarily to the safer domain of computers and software (much to his parents' relief).  The low barrier-to-entry of current open source hardware prototyping kits has led him back to his childhood passions, but now with the zeal of a "professional" experimental physicist.  His heroes include Humphrey Davy, Ben Franklin, Charles S. Peirce, and.... MacGyver.</li>
